* researching for terms in iDAI.thesauri and GettyAAT in order to map to my datafields. It turns out, that for the classification of fragments according to the part of the vessel teh stem off is not entirely possible. The terms in the iDA.thesauri as well as those of GettAAt are refering to pottery and therefore they are hierarchially subcatgories of pottery or/and their description makes a expanatory connection to pottery. As this they could blur later on searches. How to adress this in the best manner?

* how to adress the slight mismatching of terms?

* collect further insight in iDAIthesauri. Quite interesting in refering to the problem of slightly mismatching concepts, or more precisely concepts, that are part of hierarchies that refer to pottery, but describes morphological aspects not bound to pottery (like "lid"), might still be usable. Why? The iDAI.tehsauri are based on SKOS and therefore the type of relation within one Thesaurus is only broader and narrower. This means it is not determined, that a concept, which is narrow to another inherits certain traits ("Mimmi is a cat" / "a cat is a mammal").
