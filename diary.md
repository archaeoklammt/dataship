* researching for terms in iDAI.thesauri and GettyAAT in order to map to my datafields. It turns out, that for the classification of fragments according to the part of the vessel teh stem off is not entirely possible. The terms in the iDA.thesauri as well as those of GettAAt are refering to pottery and therefore they are hierarchially subcatgories of pottery or/and their description makes a expanatory connection to pottery. As this they could blur later on searches. How to adress this in the best manner?
